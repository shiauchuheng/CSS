Part1: Crawler
crawler of all_cs_comference.ipynb is to collect all website links of computer science conference.
Other crawlers.ipynb are for a specific website of cs conference.

We can't write one crawler doing all things automatically, and we found that writing a crawler for each website is not so effecient, so we collect data manully.

Part2: Analyze data
1.term frequency
(term_frequency.ipynb term_frequency_tagged.ipynb)

2.document frequency
(document_frequency.ipynb document_frequency_tagged.ipynb)

3.cosine similarity
(cosine_similarity.ipynb)

Add after final presentation

4.tf-idf
(tf-idf.ipynb)

5.mutual information
(Mutual-Information.ipynb)

Part3: Data of bios for scientists 
(bios.csv)
